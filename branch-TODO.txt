* create items table
* create model, get it to be seen on screen w/ ways to edit, etc.
    * edit name
    * edit quantity
    * add arbitrary notes
    * edit description
* document whole process of following!
 - create migration (inital?)**
 - change something about item in model (idk, like add a field)
 - go through adding migration
 - go through "trimming" that migration
  o i.e. the process involved to have the app start at a correct inital (see step**)
    * semi-goal: automate the migration process?
     - limit "no-code" migrations to adding tables, col; moving data
     - only delete cols 1 migration after moving data and only if col empty
     - keep the migration as small as possible (auto-trim)
